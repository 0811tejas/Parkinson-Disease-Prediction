# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction

Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management of the disease. This project aims to develop a predictive system for the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM).
The project begins with data collection and analysis, where a dataset containing various voice-related features is examined. Data preprocessing steps, including data separation, standardization, and splitting into training and test sets, are carried out to prepare the data for model training.
A linear SVM model is then trained on the preprocessed data to classify individuals as either "Parkinson's Positive" (1) or "Healthy" (0). The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on both the training and test datasets.
In the testing phase, the SVM model is employed to predict the disease status of a given set of voice-related features. The predictive system is designed to determine whether the individual has Parkinson's Disease or not based on the input data.
